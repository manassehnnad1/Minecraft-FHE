MINECRAFT-FHE GATEWAY!

A Privacy-preserving gateway to exclusive minecraft worlds using the Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) tech by @zama-ai

This application demonstrates how users can prove they meet age requirements (18+) without revealing their exact age through cryptographic privacy techniques. Users connect their wallet, submit their age through encrypted verification, and gain access to a virtual Minecraft world upon successful verification.

Here is a detailed guide of my development incase you want to reproduce: https://medium.com/@islathebuilder/build-your-first-privacy-preserving-dapp-with-fhevm-by-zama-2ecfdd9aae56

Stack: 
> React, ts, ethers.js

> Privy for wallet auth

> Zama Relayer SDK for encryption

> Solidity
